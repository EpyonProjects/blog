# November Update

It is nearly December! That means festive times for some of our staff team, and lots of food, loosened belts and well deserved breaks.

## GitHub

Here is a run down of changes to the datapacks/GitHub side of the project. 

*Note: This is a set of headline changes, things may have been missed*

### Datapack Changes

The format for this is now as follows:
- Main People: (Change) [#PR_Number OR !Short Commit Hash]

#### New Datapack!

#### Calling Bell
This module allows you to use a village bell to summon a wandering trader. Right click a bell with an emerald, and one day you can call a wandering trader to visit your base! Perfect for completing your collection of saplings, or when playing skyblock with your friends.


> "I was playing SkyBlock with Apple Trees installed, and Wandering Traders way took too long to spawn.  So I added a way to summon one." ~ Epyon, Datapack creator

## Wiki


### Fandom

The fandom is now... gone! Masses of the information on there was out of date and had been migrated to the [new wiki](https://wiki.gm4.co) when we moved over four years ago.

An archive will be provided at some point in the future.

### Our Wiki
The wiki has seen a little love over the last few weeks!

- The carousel mentioned in the October update is now properly a carousel!
- You should be seeing more YouTube videos embedded onto pages -- we'll only be doing this as we have new videos as alot of our back catalogue is quite out of date.


## YouTube

Some awe-inspiring  videos have been released featuring our datapacks!
